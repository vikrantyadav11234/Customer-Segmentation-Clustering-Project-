Customer Segmentation 
It much easier to sell to existing customers than new ones. Some statistics to prove that: According to Marketing research company , There are chances to lose about 22.5% of old customers each year. Based on Survey, 40% of revenue comes from repeat customers.In fact, Many Marketing Metrics suggests, businesses have a 60% to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%.
Problem statement
Segment (Group/Cluster) customer on basis of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) 
Segment (Group/Cluster) Identify trends for Day, Month, Season, Time by Invoice count

Customer Segmentation Examples: - 
1. Champions are your best customers, who bought most recently, most often, and are heavy spenders.
2. Potential Loyalists are your recent customers with average frequency and who spent a good amount.
3. New Customers are your customers are not frequent shoppers. Start building relationships with these customers .
4. At Risk Customers are your customers who purchased often and spent big amounts, but haven’t purchased recently.
5. Can’t Lose Them are customers who used to visit and purchase quite often, but haven’t been visiting recently. Need to Bring them back

RFM Score 
Finally, we can rank these customers by combining their individual R, F, and M rankings to arrive at an aggregated RFM score.
