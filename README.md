RFM Score 
Finally, we can rank these customers by combining their individual R, F, and M rankings to arrive at an aggregated RFM score.
This RFM score is simply the average of the individual R, F, and M scores, obtained by giving equal weights to each RFM attribute.

Analyzing Segmentation 
few interesting segments: 
1. Champions are your best customers, who bought most recently, most often, and are heavy spenders. Reward these customers. They can become early adopters for new products and will help promote your brand.
2. Potential Loyalists are your recent customers with average frequency and who spent a good amount. Offer membership or loyalty programs or recommend related products to upsell them and help them become your Loyalists or Champions.
3. New Customers are your customers who have a high overall RFM score but are not frequent shoppers. Start building relationships with these customers by providing onboarding support and special offers to increase their visits.
4. At Risk Customers are your customers who purchased often and spent big amounts, but haven’t purchased recently. Send them personalized reactivation campaigns to reconnect, and offer renewals and helpful products to encourage another purchase.
